# Blogging-Site-with-Flask-and-SQLite

This project showcases a blogging webpage named 'BloggingSite'.
The BloggingSite uses HTML, CSS and Bootstrap as its frontend and Flask and SQLite as its backend. 
To run the code, execute the 'run.py' file.

This project was made on PyCharm as my Second Year DBMS Project.
This project is made by following the video tutorials of Corey Schafer's playlist "Python Flask Tutorial: Full-Featured Web App".
Find the playlist here: https://youtu.be/MwZwr5Tvyxo?si=FnEFIfUcjE9pMn49 .
In Pycharm, you may see some red error lines, but still the code will run successfully, unless the local server shows some error.

The dependencies/packages that are needed to be installed for the successful execution are:
- flask
- flask-wtf
- flask-bcrypt
- flask-sqlalchemy
- flask-login
- Pillow {for resizing of image, not so necessary}
- flask-mail

To view the details of the database "site.db", download the "DB Browser for SQLite" by following link:
